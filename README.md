## Hi, I'm Nikhil 👋🏽👨🏽‍💻

Senior Frontend Developer, with expertise in React.js with TypeScript.

I have 5 years of experience in architecting projects by bringing in the best tools, implementing best practices, and making apps scalable and maintainable in the long run. This includes setting up the folder structure, state management, authentication, data fetching, routing, rendering, styling, and testing.

Developed independent, reusable, responsive React components in a component library by following a design system with Storybook. I'm a design system advocate. Checkout my [react component library](https://github.com/Nikhil-Kumaran/nk-design-system). 

I involve in the complete lifecycle of a feature from design discussions to deployment. I have strong experience with build tools like Webpack and Babel. Checkout my [reactjs-boilerplate tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reactjs-boilerplate). I use redux for state management when necessary. I unit test my react components with react-testing-library and perform end to end functionality testing with Puppeteer.

I have experience in profiling and improving the performance of React applications. Checkout my blog post on [React optimizations](https://dev.to/nikhilkumaran/react-performance-improvements-make-your-react-app-performant-12bm)

I have experience in upgrading legacy React applications(v0.14.0 and v15.5.0) to the latest. These two applications are not bootstrapped with "create-react-app", had their own Webpack and babel configs that needed migration to the latest version.

I have experience in SSR and SSG. I developed my [blog website](https://nikhilkumaran.dev) using Next.js.

Apart from constant self-learning, I always had a soft corner for knowledge sharing. I share my knowledge by writing blog posts, giving tech talks, and contributing to open-source projects. I also mentored interns in Frontend development. I have a Complete Frontend course which you can checkout here - [Course](https://nikhilkumaran.notion.site/Complete-Frontend-course-Nikhil-Kumaran-S-bf031a4ce4be4cd59a8f7518030e3c4f)
